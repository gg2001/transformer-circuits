Although language has some locality (two words next to each other are more likely to share information than two words 100 tokens apart), the picture is a lot more nuanced, because which tokens are relevant to which others depends on the context of the sentence. For instance, in the sentence `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`, the names in this sentence are the most important tokens for predicting that the final token will be `\"Mary\"`, and this is because of the particular context of this sentence rather than the tokens' position.\n",

In other words, to get the logit score for a particular token at some sequence position, we just take the vector in the residual stream at that sequence position and take the inner product with the corresponding token embedding vector. This is more training-efficient (because there are fewer parameters in our model), and it might seem pricipled at first. After all, if two words have very similar meanings, shouldn't they have similar embedding vectors because the model will treat them the same, and similar unembedding vectors because they could both be substituted for each other in most output?\n",

        "Let's break down this claim. **Bigram frequencies** refers to the frequencies of pairs of words in the english language (e.g. the bigram frequency of \"Barack Obama\" is much higher than the product of the individual frequencies of the words \"Barack\" and \"Obama\"). If our model had no attention heads or MLP layers, then all we have is a linear map from our one-hot encoded token `T` to a probability distribution over the token following `T`. This map is represented by the linear transformation $t \\to t^T W_E W_U$ (where $t$ is our one-hot encoded token vector). Since the output of this transformation can only be a function of the token `T` (and no earlier tokens), the best we can do is have this map approximate the true frequency of bigrams starting with `T`, which appear in the training data. Importantly, **this is not a symmetric map**. We want `T = \"Barack\"` to result in a high probability of the next token being `\"Obama\"`, but not the other way around!\n",

There will be more paths through the model than just the \"direct path\" $W_E W_U$, but because of the residual connections there will always exist a direct path, so there will always be some incentive for $W_E W_U$ to approximate bigram frequencies.\n",

        "If you did the material on [training loops](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#training-loop) during the first week, this should all be familiar to you. If not, you can skim that section for an overview of the key concepts. The start of the **Training loop** section is most important, and the subsections on [Modularisation](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#modularisation) and [dataclasses](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#aside-dataclasses) are also very useful. Lastly, we'll also be using Weights and Biases to train our model - you can read about how to use it [here](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.4]_Optimization#what-is-weights-and-biases). Here are (roughly) all the things you should know for the following exercises:\n",
        "                \n",
        "* The key parts of a gradient update step are:\n",
        "    * Calculating the (cross-entropy) loss between a model's output and the true labels,\n",
        "    * `loss.backward()` - calculate gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters,\n",
        "    * `optimizer.step()` - update the model parameters using the gradients,\n",
        "    * `optimizer.zero_grad()` - zero the gradients so they don't accumulate.\n",
        "* We can nicely package up training loops into a class, which includes methods for training and validation steps among other things. This helps with writing code that can be reused in different contexts.\n",
        "* We can use dataclasses to store all the arguments relevant to training in one place, and then pass them to our trainer class. Autocompletion is one nice bonus of this!\n",
        "    * Be careful of scope here, you want to make sure you're referring to `self.args` within the trainer class, rather than the global `args`.\n",
        "* You can use Weights and Biases to track experiments and log relevant variables. The three essential functions are:\n",
        "    * `wandb.init()` - initialize a new run, takes arguments `project`, `name` and `config` (among others).\n",
        "    * `wandb.log()` - log a dictionary of variables, e.g. `{\"loss\": loss}`. Also takes a `step` argument.\n",
        "    * `wandb.finish()` - called at the end of training (no arguments)."

Why is this? The answer is that, much like everything to do with computational and memory costs in deep learning, it's not so simple.
