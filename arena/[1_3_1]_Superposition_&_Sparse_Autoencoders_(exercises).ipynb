        "Superposition is a crucially important concept for understanding how transformers work. A definition from Neel Nanda's glossary:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Superposition is when a model represents more than n features in an $n$-dimensional activation space. That is, features still correspond to directions, but **the set of interpretable directions is larger than the number of dimensions**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why should we expect something like this to happen? In general, the world has way more features than the model has dimensions of freedom, and so we can't have a one-to-one mapping between features and values in our model. But the model has to represent these features somehow. Hence, it comes up with techniques for cramming multiple features into fewer dimensions (at the cost of adding noise and interference between features).\n",
        "\n",
        "In these exercises, we recommend being liberal with the sections you skip (in particular, we recommend skipping sections 4 and 5 at least, unless you really want to dive deep into these topics). If you really want to speedrun SAEs (e.g. because you want to get to the exercises in 1.3.2) then at minimum we recommend section 1️⃣ and the first half of section 5️⃣ (up to but not including resampling).\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike many other topics in this chapter, there's quite a bit of theory which needs to be understood before we start making inferences from the results of our coding experiments. A key point to make here is that, perhaps more so than any other section in this chapter, we really don't understand superposition that well at all! It's hard to point to the seminal work in this field because we don't really know what the critical new insights will look like. That being said, we hope this material gives you enough directions to pursue when you're finished!"

Instead, we sometimes have **asymmetric superposition, where a single neuron detects two different features $i$ and $j$, and stores these features with different magnitudes (assume the $W_1$ vector for feature $i$ is much larger). The $W_2$ vectors have flipped magnitudes (i.e. the vector for $j$ is much larger). When $i$ is present and $j$ is not, there's no problem, because the output for feature $i$ is `large * small` (correct size) and for $j$ is `small * small` (near zero). But when $j$ is present and $i$ is not, the output for feature $j$ is `small * large` (correct size) and for $i$ is `large * large` (much larger than it should be). In particular, this is bad when the sign of output for $i$ is positive. The model fixes this by repurposing another neuron to correct for the case when $j$ is present and $i$ is not. We omit the exact mechanism, but it takes advantage of the fact that the model has a ReLU at the very end, so it doesn't matter if output for a feature is very large and negative (the loss will be truncated at zero), but being large and positive is very bad.\n",

You should be able to see when you hover over points in the first row (especially those near zero) that the standard model just maps these to zero, but the Gated model is able to separate them.

One naive idea is that it might use neurons to create a lookup table mapping sequences to arbitrary continuations. For every sequence of tokens it wishes to memorize, it could dedicate one neuron to detecting that sequence, and then implement arbitrary behavior when it fires. The problem with this approach is that it's extremely inefficient – but it seems like a perfect candidate for superposition, since each case is mutually exclusive and can't interfere.\n",

We'll see what happens when the batch sizes change, but the number of features change. According to our theory, the model should represent datapoints in superposition when the batch size is smaller than the number of features, and it should represent features in superposition when the batch size is larger than the number of features.\n",

        "    * Weight decay constrains the norm of weights, so that they don't grow too large. With no weight decay, we could in theory memorize an arbitrarily large number of datapoints and represent them evenly spaced around the unit circle; then we can perfectly reconstruct them as long as we have a large enough weight vector to project them onto.\n",
        "* The paper recommends a learning rate consisting of a linear warmup up to `NUM_WARMUP_STEPS = 2500` (i.e. we increase the learning rate linearly from zero up to `LEARNING_RATE = 1e-3`), followed by cosine decay until the end of training at `NUM_BATCH_UPDATES = 50_000`.\n",
        "* The paper recommends using a sparsity of 0.999 for the features, and 10,000 features total. However, we recommend instead using `SPARSITY = 0.99` and `N_FEATURES = 1000` (following the replication by Marius Hobbhahn). This will cause our model to train faster, while still observing fundamentally the same patterns.\n",
        "* When generating the batch of data, you should normalize it (so each vector for a given batch index & instance has unit norm). The rest of the data generation process should be the same as in the first section of this notebook.\n",
        "* Technically you only need one instance. However, we recommend using a few (e.g. 5-10) so you can pick the instance with lowest loss at the end of training. This is because (thanks to our best frend randomness) not all instances will necessarily learn the optimal solution. In our implementation (code below), we rewrite the `optimize` function to return `(batch_inst, W_inst)` at the end, where `batch_inst` is the batch which had the lowest loss by the end of training, and `W_inst` are the learned weights for that same instance. This is precisely the data you'll need to make the 2D feature plots featured in the paper.\n",

Can you find any better metrics? Can you be more reliable, or more scalable?\n",
        "- The paper [speculates](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/solu/index.html#section-4-3) that the LayerNorm after the SoLU activations lets the model \"smuggle through\" superposition, by smearing features across many dimensions, having the output be very small, and letting the LayerNorm scale it up.
